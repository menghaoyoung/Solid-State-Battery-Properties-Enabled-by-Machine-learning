# Solid-State-Battery-Properties-Enabled-by-Machine-learning

Several machine learning algorithms were evaluated to produce a good accurate model for predicting the ionic conductivity of Li-solid-state electrolyte materials. Figure S1 in the SI shows the mean absolute error (MAE) and prediction accuracy coefficient of determination (R2) of the top six models (Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting (GB), XGBoost, CatBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)).
